# Home Network Security Audit

A comprehensive security assessment and hardening of residential network infrastructure, demonstrating practical application of cybersecurity principles and network administration skills.

## 📋 Project Overview

Conducted full security audit of home network, identifying vulnerabilities and implementing industry-standard remediation measures. This project demonstrates hands-on experience with network security, router administration, and professional documentation practices.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Map and document complete network topology
- Identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- Implement security hardening measures
- Create professional audit documentation
- Establish ongoing security maintenance procedures

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Router:** AT&T CR1000A 
- **Network Mapping:** Draw.io
- **Security Tools:** MAC address lookup, port scanning analysis
- **Protocols:** WPA2, WireGuard VPN, TCP/UDP
- **Documentation:** Professional audit report format

## 📊 Deliverables

- [Network Audit Report](./Home-Network-Security-Audit/network-audit-report.pdf) - Complete security assessment documentation
- **Network Topology Diagram** - Visual representation of network architecture
- **Device Inventory** - Complete asset list with MAC addresses
- **Remediation Documentation** - Before/after configurations

## 💡 What I Learned

This project provided hands-on experience with:

**Technical Skills:**
- Router administration and configuration (firmware management, port forwarding, guest networks)
- Network topology mapping and documentation
- MAC address identification and vendor lookup techniques
- Security vulnerability assessment and risk prioritization
- Port forwarding analysis and firewall configuration

**Security Concepts:**
- Network segmentation principles and implementation
- Understanding WPS vulnerabilities and exploitation methods
- Risk assessment methodology (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Principle of least privilege in network design
- The security trade-offs of convenience features

**Problem-Solving:**
- Systematic device identification through MAC address investigation
- Distinguishing between security risks and system configurations
- Balancing security requirements with functional needs (e.g., VPN access)

**Key Insight:** This audit reinforced that convenience features often introduce security vulnerabilities. Effective security requires understanding both technical implementation and underlying attack vectors—knowing what to secure isn't enough without understanding why it's vulnerable.

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases competencies in:
- Network troubleshooting and documentation
